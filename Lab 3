# Executive Summary

Continuing from the last Unit there a plenty of useful information that is spoken about that will be usefully to many. Using programs such as Python and learning about the commands that can be done in Python. Also discussing what Tri-c has to offer to their students to help them succeed their careers and opening their eyes to much more.

#  Software 

There are many steps that go into creating software. Software is an important component for the computer. With that being stated there are two types of software that makes up a computer, operating systems and application software both plays an important roles but both are completely different. An operating system manages the hardware and makes the interface between the hardware and user. Apple and Microsoft would be examples of operating systems, newer versions of windows and iOS is changing the interface of the operating system. An application software  creates the category for the user’s programs. For example the 1990 release of Windows 3.0 Microsoft was able to find a successful graphical user interface. Also there are a utility software utility allows you to fix or modify the computer in a way, an example of this an antivirus software.

In the 1990s the need for organizations to back their information became more needed, the enterprise resource planning system (ERP) created to bring entire organization information into are software application. A ERP system uses a database to hold all the organization information into one system. An example of ERP system would be companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Walmart using the software to hold their company information.


# Virtualization

A virtualization can make issues disappear for many IT services with the abilities virtualization has to offer. Physical hardware’s can reach its full potential due to visualization; the full capacity can be distributed to all users. Normally three physical servers are used each server plays a critical part for the hardware. Virtualization eliminate one of the server because only two severs is needed. One sever can rest while the other two servers is doing the work.
	
A virtualization technology goes back to the 1960s; it wasn’t until the early 2000s that it became very popular. Technology such as hypervisors were used, hypervisors allowed multiple users accesses to perform batch processing. Batch processing was a known computer style that could run routine tasks thousands of times at a quick pace. 

# Python

The differences between Interrupted and completed is that interpreted is mobile, Interpreted is able to be accessed on all operating systems while complied doesn’t. Also Pseudo-code is the guide for working in python it provides commands for the programmer to use.

# Career Exploration 

I currently spent some time on the Tri-c college central website. There are plenty of useful resources that can be used; the website offers plenty of resources that can be beneficial to the public. There are one aspect that caught my eye and was very helpful to me was the “Jobs Central” search tab, this tab allows you find a job in your career field. With options such as the location, the date the job was posted, and the job type. 

With Tri-c college central job search tab being a great source to find a job but there is another great source to find a job in your career field. Bureau of Labor statistics is a website that goes into full depth of thousands of jobs. After I am done with college I want to be a web designer. BLS goes into full depth providing plenty of details about web designing. Discussing salary, work environment, and job locations.

# Certificates

I recently looked certificates that Tri-c has to offer to students, there are types of certificates that are offered. Post and short-term certificates is offered at Tri-c, I looked into the career certificate that Tri-c has to offer for my career. Web design is a short term certificate; also Tri-c informs students what is needed in order to receive a certificate. Tri-c displays the math and reading requirements, what you will achieve from these classes, and as well the classes that will be taken.

# Industry Associations / Student Organizations under Career Exploration

In order to be a co-op at Tri-c there are a few things that is required from the student, must be enrolled at Tri-c. You must have a 2.75 GPA or higher to apply for co-op. Lastly 12 credit hours must be earned as well to apply for a co-op. There are benefits of being a co-op, students will earn up to a credit every 180 hours a semester.
	
The purpose of IEE is to advance technological innovation, also benefit to the society. An membership would be beneficial because it would open people to new technology allowing them to use more of their creativity.

# Conclusion


Coming to the end of this unit plenty of useful resources was discussed that will help out numerous young programmers. Discovering things such as Python, complied languages, and servers. As well discovering what Tri-c have to offer their students to pursue their careers.
